# howManyImputations 0.2.2.9001

- Because this package is just a thin wrapper around von Hippel (2020)'s work,
  added citation to that paper rather than this package.
- Added function `howManyImputations()` with a warning to direct users to the
  proper `how_many_imputations()`.
- Fixes to documentation.
