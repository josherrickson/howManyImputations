# howManyImputations 0.2.4.9001

- No need to be so strict on name; `howManyImputations()` and
  `how_many_imputations()` are aliases.
- Switch from **testthat** to
  [**tinytest**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tinytest)
- Confirmed [**Amelia**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Amelia) is supported
  by **howManyImputations**; added example to home page.

# howManyImputations 0.2.4

- Updated CITATION to use `bibentry()`.

# howManyImputations 0.2.3

- Because this package is just a thin wrapper around von Hippel (2020)'s work,
  added citation to that paper rather than this package.
- Added function `howManyImputations()` with a warning to direct users to the
  proper `how_many_imputations()`.
- Fixes to documentation.

# howManyImputations 0.2.2

First release on CRAN.
