Title: Calculate How many Imputations are Needed for Multiple Imputation
Version: 0.2.4.9001
Description: When performing multiple imputations, while 5-10 imputations are
             sufficient for obtaining point estimates, a larger number of
             imputations are needed for proper standard error estimates.
             This package allows you to calculate how many imputations are
             needed, following the work of von Hippel (2020)
             <doi:10.1177/0049124117747303>.
