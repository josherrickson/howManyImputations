\title{How Many Imputations?}
\usage{
how_many_imputations(model, cv = 0.05, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Either a \code{mira} object (created by running a model on a
data set which was imputed using \code{mice}) or a \code{mipo} object
(creating by running \code{pool()} on a \code{mira} object), or any object
which can be converted to \code{mira} via \code{as.mira}.}

\item{cv}{Desired precision of standard errors. Default to .05. If the data
were re-imputed, the estimated standard errors would differ by no more than
this amount.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for choice of "conservative" FMI.}
}
\value{
The number of required imputations to obtain the \code{cv} level of
  precision.
}
\description{
Implements two-stage "how_many_imputations" from von Hippel (2018)
}
\details{
The old advice of 5-10 imputations is sufficient for a point estimate (e.g.
an estimated coefficient), but not for estimates of standard errors (and
consequently, hypothesis tests or confidence intervals).

von Hippel (2018) provides a way to calculate the number of imputations
needed to have consistent estimates of the standard error. To do so requires
an estimate of the Fraction of Missing Information (FMI) which can only be
obtained after running some number of imputations. Therefore, von Hippel
(2018) recommends the following procedure:

\enumerate{
  \item Carry out a limited number of imputations to enable estimation of the
  FMI. von Hippel (2018) recommends 20 imputations.
  \item Use this function, \code{howManyImputations}, to calculate how many
  total imputations you will need.
  \item If the number of total imputations you will need is larger than your
  initial batch of 20, run additional imputations.
}

\examples{
data(airquality)
# Add some missingness
airquality[4:10, 3] <- rep(NA, 7)
airquality[1:5, 4] <- NA
airquality <- airquality[-c(5, 6)]
impdata1 <- mice::mice(airquality, m = 5, maxit = 10, method = 'pmm', seed = 500)
modelFit1 <- with(impdata1, lm(Temp ~ Ozone + Solar.R + Wind))
how_many_imputations(modelFit1)
how_many_imputations(modelFit1, cv = .01)

# Using a non-`mice` library.
library(jomo)
library(mitools) # for the `imputationList` function
jomodata <- jomo::jomo1(airquality, nburn = 100, nbetween = 100, nimp = 5)
impdata2 <- mitools::imputationList(split(jomodata, jomodata$Imputation))
modelfit2 <- with(impdata2, lm(Temp ~ Ozone + Solar.R + Wind))
how_many_imputations(modelfit2)
